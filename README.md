# Next.js 15 App Router: Asynchronous Request Object Issue in Server Components

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js 15's App Router when using server components with dynamic routes and asynchronous operations.  The issue arises when attempting to access the `request` object within an asynchronous function after the initial response has been sent. This can lead to the `request` object being undefined or causing errors.

## Bug Description

The `request` object, containing headers, cookies, and other request-related information, is typically available within a server component's `GET` or `POST` function. However, if an asynchronous operation is performed (e.g., a database query, external API call), and that operation completes *after* the response has already been sent, the `request` object might no longer be accessible, resulting in undefined values or errors.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Access a dynamic route; you'll likely see an error or undefined `headers` in the console (see bug.js for the problematic code).

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that all necessary operations using the `request` object are completed *before* any asynchronous operations that might delay the response.  Alternative strategies include using a separate asynchronous function to handle the delayed task or managing state effectively.
